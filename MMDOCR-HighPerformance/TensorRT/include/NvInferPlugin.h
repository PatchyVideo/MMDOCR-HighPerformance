//! (i.e., lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute.

//! Input1 is expected to be a 3-D float scores tensor of shape [batch_size, num_boxes, num_classes]

//! Registered plugin type "BatchedNMS_TRT". Registered plugin version "1".

//! are computed per instance per channel.
//! \param epsilon The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero.
