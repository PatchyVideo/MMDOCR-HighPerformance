    //! \brief Reformat the input weights of the given shape based on the new
    //! order of dimensions.
    //!
    //! Take the weights specified by \p input with the dimensions specified by
    //! \p shape and re-order the weights based on the new dimensions specified
    //! by \p shapeOrder. The size of each dimension and the input data is not
    //! modified. The output volume pointed to by \p data must be the same as
    //! he \p input volume.
    //!
    //! Example usage:
    //! float *out = new float[N*C*H*W];
    //! Weights input{DataType::kFLOAT, {0 ... N*C*H*W-1}, N*C*H*W size};

    //! \param input The input data to re-order.
    //! \param order The new order of the data sub-buffers.
    //! \param num The number of data sub-buffers to re-order.
    //! \param size The size of each data sub-buffer in bytes.
    //!
    //! \brief Takes an input stream and re-orders \p num chunks of the data
    //! given the \p size and \p order.
    //!
    //! In some frameworks, the ordering of the sub-buffers within a dimension
    //! is different than the way that TensorRT expects them.
    //! TensorRT expects the gate/bias sub-buffers for LSTM's to be in fico order.
    //! TensorFlow however formats the sub-buffers in icfo order.
    //! This helper function solves this in a generic fashion.
    //!
    //! Example usage output of reshapeWeights above:
    //! int indir[1]{1, 0}
    //! int stride = W*H;
    //! for (int x = 0, y = N*C; x < y; ++x)
    //! reorderSubBuffers(out + x * stride, indir, H, W);
